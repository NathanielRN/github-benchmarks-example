# GitHub Benchmarks Example

This repo is a test to confirm that the GitHub Action [github-action-benchmark](https://github.com/rhysd/github-action-benchmark) correctly reports on benchmark changes between PRs. This repo uses GitHub actions and the github-action-benchmark feature that pushes the results to the github-pages page for this repo.

Notably, it validates the behavior of the GitHub Action for pushing to `gh-pages` when there are performance tests across multiple packages.
